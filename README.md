### java-team-2-project

Given the working title: Uber for submarines,  this is the final project by BBD's second Java interns' team of 2021. It is a tool for consulting other developers or engineers for their technical skills and knowledge. In a way, similar to Fiverr, except, you do not have to fish for one person you want to consult,  you post a problem and potential consultants have their pick at it.  Where there are multiple consultants offering to help,  you get to choose between them with the help of their information which is also stored in our database when they register.

The cool thing about this platform is that it allows developers to help each other,  forming some kind of a community of paid help. Like merging Stackoverflow with Fiverr... SoftHelp.
